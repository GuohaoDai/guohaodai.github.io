## About Me

I am a compassionate person who cherishes my family and friends. I enjoy playing video games and watching TV shows on platforms like Netflix and others. The American pop culture has deeply influenced me.



## Dream

I have always had a passion for architecture, and from a young age, my dream was to become an architect. This dream was initially sparked by playing the game *Minecraft*, where I would design and build everything from medieval castles to Gothic churches. I am a romantic person in some ways.
